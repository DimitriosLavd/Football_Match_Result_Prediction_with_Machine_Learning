# Creating a machine learning algorithm to predict the outcomes of football matches. 

### Project Overview

My data analysis journey started by learning about data analysis processes and tools. For the last few months, I learned how to use Excel, Python, R and SQL to extract useful insights from large and complex data-sets. 

The next logical step in my journey was to develop my first predictive machine learning algorithm. To do so, I decided to use python programming in order to develop a random - forest classifier. Although I could use a random forest algorithm about virtually anything, I decided to use my passion about football as fuel for this project. 

### Project layout and goals

In this project, we will attempt to use factors that govern a football match in order to predict the final outcome of the game. A football match can have 3 possible outcomes, home win, away win and draw. If we try to predict the outcome completely by random, we have a 33% chance to correctly predict the outcome. Given the - 3 possible results - nature of football, we will consider a 33% prediction accuracy as a baseline in order to evaluate our model. 

There are countless factors that govern a football match. We decided to use 20 factors to try and predict the outcome of each game. These factors are the following

1. Home team - expected goals per game: The average number of goals per game, that the home team is expected to score, based on the quality of the chances they produce.

2. Away team - expected goals per game: The average number of goals per game, that the home team is expected to score, based on the quality of the chances they produce.

3. Home team - clean sheet percentage: The percentage of the matches in which the home team did not concede a goal.

4. Away team - clean sheet percentage: The percentage of the matches in which the away team did not concede a goal.

5. Home team - failed to score percentage: The percentage of the matches in which the home team failed to score.

6. Away team - failed to score percentage: The percentage of the matches in which the away team failed to score.

7. Home team  - both team to score percentage: The percentage of matches in which both the home team and their opponent managed to score

8. Away team  - both team to score percentage: The percentage of matches in which both the away team and their opponent managed to score
